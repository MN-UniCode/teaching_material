parts:\n","\n","- **Goal function**: determines if the attack is successful or not: evaluates how well a perturbed attacked_text object is achieving a specified goal. A common goal function is **targeted**/**untargeted classification**, where the attack tries to perturb an input to change its classification.\n","\n","- **Transformation**: takes a text input and transforms it, for example by replacing words or phrases with similar ones, while trying not to change the meaning. Paraphrase and synonym substitution are two broad classes of transformations.\n","\n","- **Constraints**: determine whether or not a given transformation is valid. Transformations don't perfectly preserve syntax or semantics, so additional constraints can increase the probability that these qualities are preserved from the source to adversarial example. There are many types of constraints: overlap constraints that measure edit distance, syntactical  constraints check part-of-speech and grammar errors, and semantic constraints like language models and sentence encoders.\n","\n","- **Search method**: explores the space of possible transformations within the defined constraints and attempt to find a successful perturbation which satisfies the goal function. Some examples are greedy search with word importance ranking, beam search, brute force, and genetic algorithm.\n","\n","\n","In this way, attacking an NLP model can be framed as a combinatorial search problem. The attacker must search within all potential transformations to find a sequence of transformations that generate a successful adversarial example.\n","\n","TextAttack provides a set of **Attack Recipes** that assemble attacks from the literature from these four components. We can exploit an attack recipe or build an attack from scratch.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QMj6vYNRr1IB"},"source":["# Example 1: Attack
